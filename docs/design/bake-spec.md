# 3D → Sprite Bake Spec

The authoring contract for generating Workling and foe sprites from Blender. Everything
here is a **parameter**, not a baked-in authoring choice: the camera is a turntable and
the framing is derived, so changing the angle later is a re-render, not a re-author.

Companion docs: [Characters](characters.md) for the roster and the pose contract,
[Sprite prompts](sprite-prompts.md) for the interim image-model prompts this pipeline
eventually replaces.

## 1. World scale

One number everything else derives from:

> **1.00 Blender Unit = the height of a standard Workling, nose-to-ground in idle.**

Build every family rig to exactly 1.0 BU tall. Size differences between creatures are
expressed by **building the model bigger**, never by moving the camera or changing the
ortho scale.

| Creature | Height (BU) |
| --- | --- |
| Workling (all five families) | 1.00 |
| Mote | 0.35 |
| Flicker | 0.70 |
| Snag | 0.95 |
| Monolith (boss) | 1.80 |

## 2. Camera

Never rotate the camera directly — Euler order will diverge across rigs. Use a turntable:

```
Empty (plain axes), named CAM_TARGET, at (0, 0, 0.5)   ← mid-body of a 1.0 BU creature
└── Camera (child of CAM_TARGET)
      local location  = (0, -6, 0)
      local rotation  = (90°, 0°, 0°)      ← set once, never touched again
      type            = Orthographic
      Orthographic Scale = 1.5
```

The **only** two knobs, both on `CAM_TARGET`:

| Knob | Blender field | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Elevation — the 3/4 down-angle | `CAM_TARGET` rotation **X** | **−18°** |
| Azimuth — the 3/4 side-turn | `CAM_TARGET` rotation **Z** | **+35°** |

Orthographic, not perspective: a perspective lens makes the Strike lunge read subtly
larger than the idle, and you will fight that forever. Ortho also means the ortho scale
is a single global constant, which is what makes the framing contract in §4 automatic.

**Ortho Scale = 1.5 is global.** Same value for every pose, every family, every foe.
Never re-frame a shot.

### Facing

Existing sheets face **left**. All three current anchors carry asymmetric accessories
(the moss-fox's bell, the pangolin's back key, the newt's tail ember), so a horizontal
mirror puts them on the wrong side. Bake both facings rather than flipping in code:

- `face-left` → `CAM_TARGET` Z = **+35°**
- `face-right` → `CAM_TARGET` Z = **−35°**

Same pose data, one extra render pass, no extra authoring.

## 3. Lighting

Three **Sun** lamps (not points — sun lamps light identically wherever in frame the pose
sits), all parented to `CAM_TARGET` so they follow the angle if it ever changes.

| Lamp | Azimuth (rel. camera) | Elevation | Strength | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Key** | −35° | 50° | 1.0 | The upper-left key light the existing sprites read as |
| **Fill** | +110° | 15° | 0.20 | Lifts the shadow side, keeps the silhouette readable |
| **Rim** | +160° | 60° | 0.60 | The "gentle rim light" that separates from a dark dungeon |

Render settings:

- **Film → Transparent: ON.** No ground plane, no baked shadow.
- **View transform: Standard.** Not Filmic/AgX — those desaturate, and the palettes are
  hand-picked in `assets/worklings-<family>-spritesheet.png`. Match the existing sheets.
- **Colour: sRGB, straight alpha, 8-bit PNG.**

### Contact shadow

The sprite carries **no shadow**. The game draws a contact ellipse under the sprite at
runtime, so it can move and scale per encounter. This is what lets a 3/4 angle read as a
place while the sprite itself stays a clean transparent cutout.

If you want a shape-matched shadow later, render it as a **separate pass to its own PNG**
— never composite it into the cell.

## 4. Framing contract

Because the camera is fixed and ortho, all of this is automatic. It only breaks if you
**translate the object** between poses — so pose the bones, never the object. Lunges,
hops and the downed sprawl translate the topmost bone of the spine chain, with a budget of
**±0.25 BU horizontal / ±0.15 BU vertical**; the safe margin below is sized for exactly
that envelope.

At the 512px cell (§5), with Ortho Scale 1.5:

- **341 px per Blender Unit.** A standard 1.0 BU Workling is **341px tall in a 512px
  cell** — 67% of cell height.
- **Ground contact sits at y = 488** (24px above the cell bottom).
- **Root/hips centre at x = 256.**
- **Safe margin: 16px.** Nothing may enter the outer 16px of any cell.

Frame once for the **widest** pose in the set — Strike's forward lunge and Victory's
raised paw — and let the quiet poses sit in empty space. Do not tighten the frame on
idle; a sheet that re-frames per pose visibly breathes in game.

The Monolith at 1.8 BU renders 614px and overflows a 512 cell. **Bosses bake into a
1024px double cell**, same camera, same ortho scale, so their size relative to a Workling
is physically true rather than art-directed.

## 5. Output — the 1080p update

**This supersedes the previous 256px cell.** The dungeon stage bakes once at a ceiling
that serves a 1080p fullscreen stage (and downsamples cleanly to the 720p window), so the
old 256px cell is roughly half the resolution needed.

| | Old | **New** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cell | 256 × 256 | **512 × 512** |
| Sheet (4×5 grid) | 1024 × 1280 | **2048 × 2560** |
| Render size (per pose) | 1024² | **2048²** |
| Downsample | 4× Lanczos | **4× Lanczos** |

Render each pose at **2048², downscale to 512²** with Lanczos. The 4× supersample is what
produces the clean pixel-cluster read without dither noise.

The app no longer hardcodes the cell size — `WorklingSprite` derives it from the sheet's
own width (`sheet.width / 4`), so **1024-wide and 2048-wide sheets both work**. Families
can be re-baked one at a time; nothing has to land as a big-bang swap.

### Grid layout

Fixed 4-column × 5-row grid, matching `WorklingSpriteFrame` in
`Sources/Worklings/WildkinPetView.swift`:

| Row | Col 0 | Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | idle | idleBlink | walkContact | walkPassing |
| **1** | walkContactOpposite | walkPassingOpposite | happy | caredFor |
| **2** | hungry | sleepy | sad | wary |
| **3** | strike | hurt | lowHP | victory |
| **4** | downed | brace | signature | *(unused)* |

### Naming

Name renders with a **frame index from day one**, even though every pose is a single
still today:

```
wildkin_strike_face-left_0000.png
```

The whole point of moving to 3D is that Strike becomes a 6-frame loop later. The index
costs nothing now; retrofitting it across five families of assets costs a lot.

### Weight

Commit the **assembled sheets only**. Keep `.blend` files and per-pose intermediate
renders out of git (or under LFS) — the repo's history is already heavy, and a 2048×2560
RGBA sheet is roughly 4× the old one.

## 6. The rig — as built

**This section records the rig that exists, and supersedes the earlier draft in this
doc's history.** The approach changed in a way worth naming: motion is not transferred
between characters as posed data, it is **generated by script against fixed bone names**.
Per-character work is *fitting*, not posing.

### The contract

**25 bones, fixed names, fixed hierarchy.** The names are the contract — `blender_walk_cycle.py`
addresses bones by name, so a gait authored once **retargets to a new character by
re-fitting markers rather than by re-authoring motion**.

That inverts the earlier plan. Under a pose-asset library, every pose is authored data
that has to be applied and fixed up per rig. Here the motion lives in the script, keyed to
names, and a new character costs a marker pass. The consequence is the same as before but
sharper: **a rig that renames a bone silently opts out of every gait**, so names are not
a convention, they are the interface.

### Hierarchy

| Block | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| Spine | spine chain |
| Head | neck → head → jaw |
| Ears | ear ×2 |
| Limbs | four limb chains, each ending **heel + toe** |
| Tail | tail ×2 |

> **To fill in:** the authoritative 25 names and their parenting, lifted from
> `blender_walk_cycle.py` rather than retyped, so the doc cannot drift from the script.

### The 31 markers

Markers are **the only per-character work**. Each is expressed as a **fraction of that
character's bounding box**, never as an absolute position — assets arrive unit-normalised
(see §1), so absolute numbers do not transfer between characters and fractions do.

**Every marker must exist, even where the anatomy does not.** Snag has no tail; its three
tail markers are parked as a stub inside the rump, so the bones still exist and take
negligible weight. A missing marker is not an option — a degenerate *placement* is. This
is what keeps the bone list at a hard 25 for every creature, which is in turn what lets
the script assume it.

(The counts line up: a two-bone tail chain needs three markers — base, mid, tip.)

> **To fill in:** the 31 marker names and their bounding-box fractions for a reference
> character.

### Why the foot is two segments

`paw` is the **heel**; `toe` sits ahead of it.

A single `wrist → paw` bone pivots like a peg: lifting it **raises the toe instead of
dropping it**, and the foot reads as a stiff paddle in every gait and every planted pose.
Heel plus toe lets the foot **roll** — heel strike, roll through, toe-off — which is most
of what makes a walk cycle read as weight rather than as sliding.

This is the one place where an extra bone pair pays for itself several times over, and
it's worth protecting if the bone count is ever squeezed.

### What still holds from the earlier plan

- **Unit-normalised assets** (§1) — reinforced, not superseded: it is precisely what makes
  fractional markers portable.
- **The object never translates** (§4). Translation happens on the topmost bone of the
  spine chain, within the framing budget in §4.

### Superseded

The earlier draft specified 40 bones legged / 16 legless, a five-bone tail, no jaw bone,
face-on-shape-keys-only, and a shared pose-asset library. None of that describes the rig
that exists. The shape-key expression recipes are **parked pending a decision** — the
as-built rig has a `jaw` bone, so some expression is now bone-driven, and how much of the
face remains on shape keys is an open question rather than a settled one.

## 7. The poses

19 total: the 12 base poses (shipped) plus the 7 combat poses. Reads are the contract —
each must be distinguishable from every other at cell size.

### Base (12)

| Pose | Read |
| --- | --- |
| **idle** | Neutral standing, weight settled, alert but calm |
| **idleBlink** | Identical to idle, eyes closed — the only difference |
| **walkContact** / **walkPassing** | Two-frame walk cycle, lead leg forward |
| **walkContactOpposite** / **walkPassingOpposite** | The same cycle on the opposite legs |
| **happy** | Bright and up — ears up, tail up, open expression |
| **caredFor** | Softer than happy — contented, eyes half-closed, settled |
| **hungry** | Drooping, looking up/off expectantly, one paw raised |
| **sleepy** | Heavy-lidded, head low, mid-yawn or about to be |
| **sad** | Ears flat, head and tail down, closed posture |
| **wary** | Low crouch, head forward, alert and suspicious — tense, not scared |

### Combat (7)

| Pose | Read |
| --- | --- |
| **strike** | Mid-lunge, body stretched forward, front paw/claw landing, fierce |
| **hurt** | Recoiling back, head turned aside, off-balance, wincing |
| **lowHP** | Hunched, staggering, breathing hard — combat exhaustion, *not* sleep |
| **victory** | Chest up, one paw raised high, joyful and heroic — more than happy |
| **downed** | Collapsed on its side, limbs splayed, eyes shut — defeated, *not* asleep |
| **brace** | Defensive crouch behind a raised guard (paw/tail/scaled back), focused |
| **signature** | Charging a special: heroic stance, building energy, family-coloured aura |

The signature aura is family-coloured: Wildkin swirling green nature-glow, Elemental
flaring orange fire, Relicborn radiant cyan rune-light, Glitchkin unstable violet-white
signal static, Bloomglass pale refracted starlight.

Two pairs are the ones that go wrong most often and are worth checking side by side:
**sleepy vs downed** and **lowHP vs sad**.

## 8. Manifest

Commit `assets/bake-manifest.json` **before rendering anything**. It is what makes the
camera decision reversible — without it, "re-bake at 22°" is archaeology across five
`.blend` files.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "world": { "unit": "1.0 BU = standard Workling height" },
  "camera": { "type": "ortho", "elevationDeg": -18, "azimuthDeg": 35, "orthoScale": 1.5,
              "targetHeightBU": 0.5 },
  "lighting": { "rigVersion": 1, "keyAzimuthDeg": -35, "keyElevationDeg": 50,

                 "monolith": 1.8 },
  "facings": ["face-left", "face-right"]
}
```

## 9. Foe pose sheets

Foes do **not** use the Workling 4×5 pose sheet. They have three poses — `idle`,
`attack`, `hurt` — delivered as **one file per pose**, and each file is either a single
still or an animation sheet.

| | Single still | Animation sheet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Layout | one cell | **4 columns, row-major**, filled left-to-right, top-to-bottom |
| Size | `cell × cell` | `(4 × cell) × (rows × cell)` |
| Example | 512×512 | 8 frames → 2048×1024 |

Cell size is read off the sheet's own width (`width / 4`), so any cell size works. **New
foe art uses the 512px cell** (§5). Everything in §2–§4 applies unchanged — same camera,
same lighting, same ortho scale, same ground-contact line — so a foe's size relative to a
Workling comes out physically true. Snag is **0.95 BU** (§1).

### Filenames

```
assets/foes/<base>-idle.png
assets/foes/<base>-attack.png
assets/foes/<base>-hurt.png
```

`<base>` is lowercase and matches the entry in `FoeSpriteAsset.resourceBase(for:)`.
Registered today: `mote` (display name "Dungeon Scamp"), `snag` ("Snag").

### Frame count is declared, not inferred

The frame count lives in `FoeSpriteAsset.frameCount(foe:pose:)`, not in the file. A 4×4
sheet is square and therefore indistinguishable from a single still, so inferring it from
the image would be a guess that silently breaks at 16 frames. Adding an animated pose is
one line there.

### Playback

- **12 fps** (`FoeSprite.frameDuration`). Slow enough to read as hand-animated next to
  the pixel art, fast enough that an 8-frame swing lands inside a combat beat.
- **A pose plays once and holds its last frame.** It restarts from frame 0 every time the
  foe enters that pose, rather than joining a free-running loop mid-swing.
- **`idle` is the exception — it loops.**

> The consequence worth designing around: **the last frame of an animated pose is what
> the foe sits on for the rest of the beat.** Author it as a settle that reads held, not
> as the end of a follow-through.

### Recommended attack breakdown — 8 frames

8 frames at 12fps is 0.67s, which fits comfortably inside a combat beat.

| Frames | Beat | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0–1 | **Anticipation** | Wind back *away* from the pet. The clearest read in the whole swing; don't rush it |
| 2 | **Contact** | The extreme. One frame only — impact reads as a snap, not a hold |
| 3–4 | **Follow-through** | Overshoot past the contact pose, then start back |
| 5–7 | **Recovery** | Settle toward neutral; **frame 7 should read as a held pose** |

For Snag specifically — a knot of tangled thorny threads that *grabs* rather than strikes
— the anticipation is the tendrils gathering/coiling inward and the contact is them
lashing outward. It has a Snare (an Agility debuff), so the silhouette wants to read as
*seizing*, not punching.

### Dropping a new foe in

1. Bake the three PNGs to `assets/foes/`.
2. Add them to `Package.swift` `resources:` — `.copy("../../assets/foes/snag-idle.png")`
   and the other two. **A `.copy` of a missing file fails the build**, which is why the
   entries are not pre-added for art that doesn't exist yet.
3. Register the base name in `FoeSpriteAsset.resourceBase(for:)` if it isn't already.
4. Declare any multi-frame pose in `FoeSpriteAsset.frameCount(foe:pose:)`.

Until step 1 lands, `hasArt` is false and the foe renders the existing placeholder — a
registered-but-unbaked foe degrades rather than breaks.

## 10. Dungeon stage-facing (diagonal corners)

The Cache Warren's battle stage (see [Dungeons](dungeons.md)) is a **fixed-camera room**
where the party can enter at any of its four corners — bottom-left, top-left,
bottom-right, top-right — always facing the opposite corner, where the foes wait, then
walking past them toward the exit corner on a win. Because every actor is a flat
billboard in a room whose camera never moves, whatever direction a bake visually faces is
exactly how it reads once placed — there's no runtime rotation to correct it.

This is a **different facing convention from §2's `face-left`/`face-right`**, which is a
mild ±35° turn for the character-screen portrait context. The dungeon needs a character's
body actually oriented toward a diagonal corner of the room, which turned out to need a
much larger camera turn than ±35° — closer to a back 3/4 view than a front one.

### The four corners, two real bakes

Only two of the four corner-facings are ever rendered directly; the other two are a
horizontal image mirror, because mirroring only flips the **left/right** component of a
diagonal direction and leaves **up/down** alone. Mirror pairs therefore stay on the same
vertical half — never cross top/bottom:

| Bake | `CAM_TARGET` Z | Corner it's for | Produced by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stageFaceBL` | **+35°** | Top-right (faces down-left, toward the party at BL) | Direct render |
| `stageFaceTR` | **~235–245°** (not yet narrowed) | Bottom-left (faces up-right, toward the foes at TR) | Direct render |
| `stageFaceBR` | mirror of `stageFaceBL` | Top-left (faces down-right, toward BR) | Horizontal mirror |
| `stageFaceTL` | mirror of `stageFaceTR` | Bottom-right (faces up-left, toward TL) | Horizontal mirror |

Elevation tested at **−28°** (steeper than §2's shipped −18°), bracketed against the
room's own locked 39.7° elevation. Not locked — see Open.

**Applies to animated poses too.** Since motion is a real 3D animation on the rig (§6),
not per-angle hand-drawn art, an animated pose (walk, attack, hurt, die, ...) only needs
its full frame sequence rendered from the two real azimuths above — the mirrored corners
reuse those same frames unchanged, no extra animation authoring.

## Open

- **The §2 angle itself.** −18° / +35° is the working default for the character-screen
  facing, inside the recommended 15–25° band. It is deliberately not locked; the
  turntable rig and this manifest are what keep it a cheap parameter rather than an
  expensive commitment. Bake one character at 0° / −18° / −35° elevation and compare
  three stills before locking.
- **§10's elevation and back-azimuth are unlocked.** The −28° elevation and ~235–245°
  `stageFaceTR` azimuth are from a same-day test session using a non-production stand-in
  mesh (a Hunyuan3D-generated ram, not a Workling family) — good for judging silhouette
  and angle read, not production-ready. Pending an in-scene comparison against the room's
  live camera before either number locks.
- **Asymmetric-accessory mirroring is unresolved for §10.** §2 already avoids mirroring
  production Worklings for exactly this reason — the moss-fox's bell, the pangolin's back
  key, the newt's tail ember land on the wrong side under a horizontal flip. The same
  problem applies to `stageFaceBR`/`stageFaceTL`, and for animated poses it's now
  multiplied across every frame, not just one still. Floated but not decided: simplify or
  drop asymmetric detail specifically for dungeon-scale sprites (small, seen at a
  distance) while keeping it correct on the character screen, which is a separate live-3D
  render rather than this baked pipeline. No answer yet.
- **Animation.** Everything is single-frame today. The frame index in the naming
  convention is the only concession made in advance.
